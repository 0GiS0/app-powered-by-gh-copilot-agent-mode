Your goal is generate a frontend using React that adheres to best practices for a modern web application. The application should include components to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a sample resource (e.g., 'users'). Please ensure the following:

- Use functional components with hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect).

- Structure the project with a clear folder hierarchy (e.g., components, services, utils).

- Implement state management with Context API or a suitable library (e.g., Redux).

- Use a component library for UI elements (e.g., Material-UI, Ant Design).

- Ensure responsive design and accessibility compliance.

- Implement form validation with a library (e.g., Formik, Yup).

- Include comments to explain the code.

- Provide basic documentation on how to run the project and use the components.

- Don't forget to install all the dependencies you use
