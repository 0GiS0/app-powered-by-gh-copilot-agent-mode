Create a repository structure that includes both a backend built with Node.js and Express, and a frontend built with React. The repository should also include the necessary content for Backstage. Please ensure the following:

1. **Root Directory**:
    - `README.md`: A comprehensive readme file with detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project.
    - `.gitignore`: A `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from the repository.
    - `catalog-info.yaml`: A Backstage configuration file for cataloging the project.
    - `docs/`: A directory containing documentation specific to the Backstage setup.    

2. **Backend Directory (`/backend`)**:
    - This directory will house the backend code built with Node.js and Express.

3. **Frontend Directory (`/frontend`)**:
    - This directory will house the frontend code built with React.

Please note that it is not required to include content or initialize the backend and frontend directories. Focus on the overall repository structure and ensure it follows best practices for organization and documentation.
