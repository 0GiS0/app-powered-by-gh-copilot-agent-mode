The repository structure includes both a backend built with Node.js and Express, and a frontend built with React. The repository should also include the necessary content for Backstage. Ensure the following:

1. **Root Directory**:
    - `README.md`: A detailed readme file with instructions on how to set up and run the project.
    - `.gitignore`: A .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from the repository.
    - `catalog-info.yaml`: Backstage configuration file for cataloging the project.
    - `docs/`: Documentation specific to the Backstage setup.
    - `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`: With Dev Container configuration to ensure we can run this project. 

2. **Backend Directory (`/backend`)**

3. **Frontend Directory (`/frontend`)**

It's not your job include content in backend and frontend folders.
