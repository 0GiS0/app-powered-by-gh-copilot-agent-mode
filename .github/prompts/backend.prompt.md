Your goal is gemerate a backend using Node.jsand Express that adheres to RESTful API best practices. The API should include CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for a sample resource (e.g., 'users'). Please ensure the following:

- The database is MongoDb.

- Use ES6+ syntax (e.g., arrow functions, async/await).

- Structure the project with a clear separation of concerns (e.g., controllers, services, models).

- Implement input validation and error handling.

- Use environment variables for configuration (e.g., database connection strings).

- Include comments to explain the code.

- Provide basic documentation on how to run the project and use the API endpoints.

- Don't forget to install all dependencies you need

- Do not include views as part of the project. The frontend will be in a different project

- Add a `client.http` file with the CRUD operations using REST Client extension

- Don't forget to include the .gitignore for a Node.js app
